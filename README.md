# StatsSimulationGenerator
A quick script I made for my stats class

In my statistics class, the teacher asked us to simulate making a  basketball shot when the player has an 80% average. 
Rather than randomly generate 500 numbers and then use those to do further math like the rest of my classmates, I 
decided to make a quick script to do it for me.
